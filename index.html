            Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental
            health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include
            emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).
          </p>
          <p>
            When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose
            interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to
            mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric,
            full of energy or unusually irritable.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment,
              behavior and the ability to think clearly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year.

            There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may
            include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause
            unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant
            distress and difficulty in life.

          <p>The main types of bipolar disorder are:</p>
